# PayFlow AI Spark Payment System

## Overview

PayFlow AI Spark is a modern, AI-enhanced payment processing system designed specifically for mental health applications. It provides a seamless donation experience while maintaining the highest standards of security and privacy.

## Features

- **Multiple Payment Methods**: Support for credit cards, PayPal, and other payment methods
- **Customizable Donation Amounts**: Predefined donation tiers and custom amount options
- **Secure Processing**: End-to-end encryption for all payment data
- **Donation Analytics**: Track donation patterns and impact
- **Recurring Donations**: Support for one-time and recurring donations
- **Mobile-Friendly Design**: Responsive interface that works on all devices

## Integration

The PayFlow system is designed to be easily integrated into any part of the BetterWithin application:

1. Import the PaymentSystem component
2. Add the component to your page or modal
3. Configure the success and cancel handlers
4. Customize the appearance as needed

## Usage Example

\`\`\`tsx
import { PaymentSystem } from '@/components/payment-system';

// In your component
const handleDonationSuccess = (amount: number) => {
  console.log(`Donation of $${amount} received!`);
  // Update user record, show thank you message, etc.
};

// Render the payment system
<PaymentSystem 
  onSuccess={handleDonationSuccess}
  onCancel={() => setShowPayment(false)}
  defaultAmount={10}
/>
\`\`\`

## Security Considerations

- No payment information is stored on the client
- All transactions are processed through secure, PCI-compliant services
- Personal and payment information is kept separate
- Regular security audits ensure the system remains secure

## Future Enhancements

- Additional payment methods (Apple Pay, Google Pay, cryptocurrency)
- Enhanced donation analytics and reporting
- Customizable donation campaigns
- Tax receipt generation
- Corporate matching program integration
