          "Anxiety is your body's natural response to stress. It's a feeling of fear or apprehension about what's to come. It's normal to feel anxious about moving to a new place, starting a new job, or taking a test. This type of anxiety is unpleasant, but it may motivate you to work harder and do a better job. Ordinary anxiety is a feeling that comes and goes but doesn't interfere with your everyday life.",

          "Try the 4-7-8 breathing technique: Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 7 seconds, exhale for 8 seconds. This breathing pattern aims to reduce anxiety or help people get to sleep. Some proponents claim that the method helps people get to sleep in 1 minute. Breathing techniques are designed to bring the body into a state of deep relaxation. Specific patterns that involve holding the breath for a period of time allow your body to replenish its oxygen.",

Grounding techniques help control these symptoms by turning attention away from thoughts, memories, or worries, and refocusing on the present moment. This technique can help you feel more centered and in control of your thoughts.",
